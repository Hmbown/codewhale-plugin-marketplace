// Human/agent control lease — the input gate for a shared computer.
//
// On a Codewhale Computer (a Sprite seat), a person and the agent share one
// X display and one Chromium. The Engine owns the control lease and writes its
// current holder to a small JSON file (CODEWHALE_CU_LEASE_FILE, normally
// /run/cw/lease.json, owned by cw-engine). While a person holds it, every
// input tool refuses with `computer_busy_human_driving`; observation tools
// (screenshot, get_app_state, browser_screenshot, ...) keep working so the
// agent can watch and resume after hand-back.
//
// Unlike stop_computer_control, which is a one-way kill for the session, this
// refusal is reversible: when the holder goes back to the agent (or the human
// lease expires), input works again with no restart.
//
// File contract (written atomically by the Engine, read here):
//   {"holder":"human"|"agent"|null, "since":"<ISO>", "expires_at":"<ISO>"|null, "generation":<int>}
// Rules:
//   - no CODEWHALE_CU_LEASE_FILE: no lease concept (a local desktop), never refuses;
//   - file absent: nobody holds it, the agent may act;
//   - holder "human" and expires_at absent or in the future: refuse;
//   - file present but unreadable or malformed: fail closed (`computer_lease_unreadable`).
